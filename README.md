# kn5-compatible-fbx_exporter-for-blender

Overview

This is a plugin for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) that adds a tweaked fbx exporter to preserve the import file structure presumably from Autodesk softwares.

Blender has it's own indexing system that adds .001, 002 etc. to various objects and empties to give them unique names.

This is particularly bad for pipelines involving import and export actions with .fbx files if they requires the naming structure preserved to function properly.
